class 7: Week 3 Lab

Task == Command Line, file management & GitHub
Today's Goal == upload sample files to a GitHub repo, using Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)

Upload sample files:
1. Search for files
2. Select them & add to folder...lol

Git Bash:
1. Select Windows button on desktop and type "Git bash" in search bar.
2. Right click on "Git Bash" and run as administrator
3. Use "pwd" command to find current location
4. Change directory with "cd" command
5. Practice with "pwd", "ls", "mkdir" commands for fluency



notes:
- Git Bash (shell) = a program that allows you to interact DIRECTLY with computer/server. It operates on code/specific commands. 
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) = Human interactive environment
- Using file explorer, one can organize and navigate stored files.
- In shell, "pwd" (print working directory) shows your current location in the directory
- "ls" (list) allows you to view files/folders in directory...mine did not match up
- "cd" (change directory) [directories have forward slashes after them]
- "clear" to clear out history
- "cd .." allows you to go back one directory
- "cd " (then tab button) allows for auto-complete, in most instances
- "mkdir " = make directory
- "touch [name].txt" creates image/file
- "rm [name].txt" removes image/file
- git init = initialize github
- git add = add files to staging area
- git status = shows status of directory contents
